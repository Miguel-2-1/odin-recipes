    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes the simplest meals are the best meals. One of the best dishes I've ever eaten was a tomato bisque soup, and this recipe for pan con tomate (Spanish tomato bread) is similar in its simplicity.</p>
    <p>There's only 3 ingredients: a large tomato, two slices of crusty bread, and a garlic clove. You should include some olive oil and salt as well, to taste. This will help amplify the flavor of the tomato and garlic</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
      <li>2 slices crusty bread</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, halved</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste</li>
      <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place tomato in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
      <li>Toast the bread until browned, 1 to 3 minutes. Rub each slice of toast with garlic; this is easier to do if the peel is left on.</li>
      <li>Top each slice of toast with pureed tomato. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.</li>
    </ol>
